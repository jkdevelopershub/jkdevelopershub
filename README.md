Welcome to my Github page!

My name is John Kariuki , and I'm a fullstack developer from Kenya. I have a deep passion for technology, and I love solving problems creatively. With my constantly growing skill set, I'm able to work on both the front-end and back-end of web applications, which allows me to have a diverse range of technical abilities.

What I enjoy most about being a fullstack developer is the opportunity to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies. This keeps me on my toes and helps me stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the industry.

One thing that sets me apart as a fullstack developer is my strong communication and collaboration skills. I understand that teamwork is key to delivering high-quality projects, and I always strive to communicate my ideas clearly and work effectively with others to achieve our goals.

Overall, I'm excited about the future of technology and the role I can play in shaping it as a fullstack developer.
